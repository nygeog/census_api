  Description:
    Abstract:
      TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the 
      U.S. Census Bureau.  ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau. 
      The 2002 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and 
      cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The
      TIGER/Line data are not in a mapping projection even though most of
      the features were scanned directly from source maps that were in a
      projection.  The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) is the
      coordinate datum used for the 48 contiguous states, the District of
      Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United
      States.  Regional datums are used for Hawaii and the Pacific Island
      Areas.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a 
      county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area 
      based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries.  A 
      complete set of 2002 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and 
      statistically equivalent entities in the United States, Puerto Rico, 
      and the Island Areas.  The 2002 TIGER/Line files do not include a 
      file for the Midway Islands.  The Census TIGER database represents 
      a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  
      However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand 
      alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to 
      cover the whole Nation.  The 2002 TIGER/Line files consist of line 
      segments representing physical features and governmental and 
      statistical boundaries.  The boundary information in the TIGER/Line 
      files are for statistical data collection and tabulation purposes 
      only; their depiction and designation for statistical purposes does 
      not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights 
      of ownership or entitlement.  The files contain information 
      distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects 
      of a county.  There are 19 record types, including the basic data 
      record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can 
      be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic 
      information contained in the files includes attributes such as 
      feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to 
      differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for 
      legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of 
      linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, 
      and area boundaries.  The 2002 TIGER/Line data dictionary 
      contains a complete list of all the fields in the 19 record types.
    Purpose:
      In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER 
      database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other 
      geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public 
      extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line files.  Various 
      versions of the TIGER/Line files have been released on an irregular
      schedule since 1990; previous versions of the Census 2000 series 
      include the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, the UA 
      Census 2000 TIGER/Line files and the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.

    Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency:
      TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database when 
      needed for geographic programs required to support the census and 
      survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau.  No changes or updates 
      will be made to the 2002 TIGER/Line files.  Future releases of 
      TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER 
      database and will be released under a version numbering system 
      based on the month and year the data is extracted.

    None.  Acknowledgment of the U.S. Census Bureau would be appreciated 
    for products derived from these files.  TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census 
    TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau.  ZCTA is a 
    trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau.
  Native_Data_Set_Environment:
    TIGER/Line files are created and processed in a VMS environment.  
    The environment consists of two Alpha Server 8400s clustered together 
    running OpenVMS version 6.2-1H3 used for production operations.  The 
    Census TIGER system is driven by DEC Command language (DCL) procedures 
    which invoke C software routines to extract selected geographic and 
    cartographic information (TIGER/Line files) from the operational 
    Census TIGER database.
Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Accurate against Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS), 
      FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes 
      and base names.  The remaining attribute information has been 
      examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    The feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) 
    is complete for census purposes.  Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong 
    to the "Geometry and Topology" (GT) class of objects in the "Spatial 
    Data Transfer Standard" (SDTS) FIPS Publication 173 and are 
    topologically valid.  Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain 
    relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit
    requirements.  These requirements include:
    * Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.
    * Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.
    * Complete chains do not extend through nodes.
    * Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain 
    element and are consistent throughout the extract process.
    * The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps.
    The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical 
    consistency and limits of files.  All polygons are tested for closure.  
    The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update 
    System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census 
    TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for 
    states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding 
    spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for 
    logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original 
    Census TIGER database files.  Most of the Codes themselves were provided 
    to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining 
    FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not 
    been fully tested for consistency.
  Completeness_Report:
    Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the 
    Census TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line files (2002 version) 
    were created.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The information present in these files is provided for the purposes 
        of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates 
        in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but 
        the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as  
        the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies 
        with the source materials used, but generally the information is 
        no better than the established national map Accuracy standards 
        for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); 
        thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications 
        such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses 
        that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's 
        surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy 
        standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 
        1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of 
        most of the TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census 
        Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file 
        coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare 
        favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau 
        cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 
        1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The 
        Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators 
        annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER database as 
        they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 
        2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from 
        updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau 
        programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown 
        quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, 
        portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from 
        maps and other materials prepared by private companies.  Despite the 
        fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the 
        coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful 
        when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next 
        to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, 
        on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        In order for others to use the information in the Census TIGER 
        database in a GIS or for other geographic applications, the 
        Census Bureau releases periodic extracts of selected information 
        from the Census TIGER database, organized as topologically 
        consistent networks.  Software (TIGER DB routines) written by 
        the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census 
        TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the 
        Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent 
        area.  Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical
        equivalent area is then distributed among 19 fixed length 
        record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either 
        line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census 
        Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files
        since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature 
        and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate 
        updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous 
        version.

Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major
      types of features/entities;
      Line Features -
      1) Roads
      2) Railroads
      3) Hydrography
      4) Miscellaneous transportation features and selected power lines 
      and pipe lines
      5) Legal (governmental unit) and statistical boundaries
      Landmark Features -
      1) Point landmarks, e.g., schools and churches; sporatic coverage
      added on an as-needed basis
      2) Area landmarks, e.g., Parks and cemeteries; sporatic coverage
      added on an as-needed basis
      Polygon features -
      1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the Census 
      2000 census statistical data and governmental unit boundaries
      legally in effect as of the latest Boundary and Annexation
      Survey (BAS)
      2) Locations of area landmarks
      The line features and polygon information form the majority of 
      data in the TIGER/Line files.  Some of the data/attributes 
      describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers 
      (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable 
      characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic 
      entity codes.  The Census Bureau includes landmark features
      on an as-needed-basis and has made no attempt to ensure that
      all instances of a particular landmark feature were included.  
      The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that 
      describe landmark features and provide locational reference.  
      Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature 
      Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons.
      The Census TIGER database uses collections of spatial objects 
      (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world 
      geography.  The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to 
      represent features such as streets, rivers, and political 
      boundaries and assigns attributes to these features to identify 
      and describe specific features such as the 500 block of Market 
      Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
