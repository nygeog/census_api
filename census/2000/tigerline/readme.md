##Feature Class A, Road 

######Primary Highway With Limited Access
Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges.

A11 Primary road with limited access or interstate highway, unseparated

A17 Primary road with limited access or interstate highway, separated, underpassing
A18 Primary road with limited access or interstate highway, separated, with rail line in center

######Primary Road Without Limited Access
This category (A2) includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multi-lane or single-lane characteristics.

A21 Primary road without limited access, US highways, unseparated
A22 Primary road without limited access, US highways, unseparated, in tunnel
A23 Primary road without limited access, US highways, unseparated, underpassing

A26 Primary road without limited access, US highways, separated, in tunnel
A27 Primary road without limited access, US highways, separated, underpassing
A28 Primary road without limited access, US highways, separated, with rail line in center

######Secondary and Connecting Road
This category (A3) includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category generally are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard- surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.

A37 Secondary and connecting road, state and county highways, separated, underpassing
A38 Secondary and connecting road, state and county highway, separated, with rail line in center

######Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road 
A road in this category (A4) is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads, and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.

A41 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, unseparated
A42 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, unseparated, in tunnel
A43 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, unseparated, underpassing
A44 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, unseparated, with rail line in center
A45 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, separated
A46 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, separated, in tunnel
A47 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, separated, underpassing
A48 Local, neighborhood, and rural road, city street, separated, with rail line in center

######Vehicular Trail 
A road in this category (A5) is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category A4, not A5.

A51 Vehicular trail, road passable only by 4WD vehicle, unseparated
A52 Vehicular trail, road passable only by 4WD vehicle, unseparated, in tunnel
A53 Vehicular trail, road passable only by 4WD vehicle, unseparated, underpassing

A65 Ferry crossing, the representation of a route over water that connects roads on opposite shores; used by ships carrying automobiles or people

######Road as Other Thoroughfare 
A road in this category (A7) is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.

H75 Census water boundary separating coastal water from territorial sea 
H80 Special water feature; major category used when the minor category could not be determined
H81 Glacier

##Feature Class P, Provisional Features

The U.S. Census Bureau has created a new CFCC type that may appear on street features only. Some streets that normally would be classified as "A" class features may be coded with a "P" instead of the "A" to indicate that the feature is a "provisional" feature. Provisional features are those streets that were added from reference sources or other programs in preparation for Census 2000, but were not field verified by census staff during field operations or through the use of aerial photography or imagery. As these features are verified in future operations the provisional flag will be removed for subsequent TIGER/Line releases. The numeric portion of the CFCC still classifies the street as if an "A" were preceding it.

##Feature Class X, Not Yet Classified

Classification Unknown or Not Elsewhere Classified

X00 Feature not yet classified 
All complete chains, landmarks, and key geographic locations have a code representing their census feature class. Only those GT-polygons associated with an area landmark have a CFCC. Most CFCCs in the feature classification scheme apply only to complete chains. In a few instances, the same feature code may apply to complete chains as well as to point and area landmarks.

Only those features required for census operational purposes are classified and inserted into the Census TIGER database. Therefore, not all features in a county will appear in the TIGER/Line files. Since features are classified with only a single code, a road that also is a boundary will have only the CFCC of a road even though a CFCC for a boundary exists in the classification scheme.
